# Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge

I'm not going to claim copyright for this addon. Parts of the code weren't made by me.  
The model was taken from: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=778732892

I also added a version for TTT.

## FAQ

- Wasn't it the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 that explodes?
 - Yes, but a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge exploded as well.  
 See: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1772176/samsung-s7-edge-overheated-and-then-exploded-in-teachers-hands-in-the-middle-of-busy-cafe/

- These phones aren't really exploding. The battery melts, emits smoke and sometimes it catches fire.
 - Yes. But the newspapers write that they are exploding. So I decided to make it exploding. Catching fire, melting and emitting smoke is too boring for me.

- What does this addon do?
 - If you use primary attack then the phone is held to the ear for 10 seconds. After this it explodes.
